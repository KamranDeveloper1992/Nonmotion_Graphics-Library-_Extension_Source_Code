This sample code was developed by Kamran Karimov on August 30, 2023. You can use this code as a foundation to create your own extension. The code structure is fully prepared; you just need to organize your own media files according to the format used in the code. Since there is no publicly available open-source package for such an extension worldwide, I, Kamran Karimov, am the first to develop it in Azerbaijan. After the official release, I will provide you with the source code. However, please note that while you are free to add and sell your own products, you may not resell them under the company name or the name "nonmotion." You must assign your own brand name. Otherwise, legal rights will be enforced.
